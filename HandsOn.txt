1) Write a program which prints the following information about at least 5 persons:
	NAME  MAIL-ID  EMPLOYEE-CODE  PHONE
	Eg. Umesh  umesh@cse  p03161  25764728
	Salil      salil@cse     p03160  25764728
	Each entry should be on a separate line.

2)Write a program that prints the following line on the screen along with quotes.
“Can we print ‘\’ with System.out.println() statement?”


3) Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error the compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide.

4)In the program you created in Exercise 3, try leaving the fields uninitialized and print out their values. Try the same with a local variable and see what kind of compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.

5) Write Program to show MAX,MIN & SIZE of Primitive Data Type.

6) Write Program with multiple Static and Instance Block,using this print some messages.

7)Consider the following code snippet.

int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;

    What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
    What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?


8) Change the following program to use compound assignments:

class ArithmeticDemo {

     public static void main (String[] args){
          
          int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result - 1; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result * 2; // result is now 4
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result / 2; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result + 8; // result is now 10
          result = result % 7; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);
     }
}



9) In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:

class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);    // "4"
        ++i;                     
        System.out.println(i);    // "5"
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i);    // "7"
    }
}


10) Identify the following kinds of expression statements:

    aValue = 8933.234;
    aValue++;
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();


Write Programms and share code via github

11) Find ASCII Value of a character 'X' and 'x'

12) Write Program to Compute Quotient and Remainder

13) Swap two numbers using temporary variable

14) Write Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd - 88,37,1658

15)Check whether an alphabet is vowel or consonant using if..else statement - a,b,e,o

16) Write Programm to calculate GST i.e. 18% on base price 34900/-

17) Write programm to calculate monthly simple intrest and compound intrest(5%/Month) on amount - 161258/-

18) Write program to generate equated monthly instalments (EMI)(intrest 5%/Month) of 3 year and 5 year of amount 161258/-


19) Consider the following code snippet.

if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");

    a) What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?
    b) Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? Is it what you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?
    c) Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand.
    d) Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code

20) Answer Below Questions

1) The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the ___ statement.
2) The ___ statement allows for any number of 2) possible execution paths.
3) The ___ statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the ___ of the loop.
4) How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement?
5) How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement?
