1) Write a program which prints the following information about at least 5 persons:
	NAME  MAIL-ID  EMPLOYEE-CODE  PHONE
	Eg. Umesh  umesh@cse  p03161  25764728
	Salil      salil@cse     p03160  25764728
	Each entry should be on a separate line.

2)Write a program that prints the following line on the screen along with quotes.
“Can we print ‘\’ with System.out.println() statement?”


3) Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error the compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide.

4)In the program you created in Exercise 3, try leaving the fields uninitialized and print out their values. Try the same with a local variable and see what kind of compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.

5) Write Program to show MAX,MIN & SIZE of Primitive Data Type.

6) Write Program with multiple Static and Instance Block,using this print some messages.

7)Consider the following code snippet.

int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;

    What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
    What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?


8) Change the following program to use compound assignments:

class ArithmeticDemo {

     public static void main (String[] args){
          
          int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result - 1; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result * 2; // result is now 4
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result / 2; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result = result + 8; // result is now 10
          result = result % 7; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);
     }
}



9) In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:

class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);    // "4"
        ++i;                     
        System.out.println(i);    // "5"
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i);    // "7"
    }
}


10) Identify the following kinds of expression statements:

    aValue = 8933.234;
    aValue++;
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();
